I have developed a website designed to simulate a social media platform specifically for couples. This project was actively used with my girlfrriend, featuring key functionalities such as a minimalistic social media interface, capabilities to upload photos, post and delete messages, like posts, and engage in chats. Additionally, the system sends notifications via LINE API whenever new posts are added. The website is responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices.

Technical Stack: Utilized React.js, JavaScript, CSS,Materail UI, and Node.js for development.

Database: Integrated with Firebase and Firestore for robust data management.

Deployment: The website has been successfully deployed on Netlify.
